# Project Movie Trailer
* * *

Contains the movie object, which simply initializes an object with the 3 following attributes:
- trailer_youtube_url
- title
- poster_image_url

During object instantiation, we simply enter values for all 3 of the object's properties.
The movies object created must then be added to the films variable which is then passed to open_movies_page().

open_movies_page() is part of fresh_tomatoes.py found here:
